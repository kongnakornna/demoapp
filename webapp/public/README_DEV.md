# CI-with-HMVC
Setup HMVC and local session storage with Codeigniter 3

Modules are groups of independent components, typically model, controller and view, arranged in an application modules sub-directory that can be dropped into other Codeigniter applications. This allows easy distribution of independent components (MVC) in a single directory across other CodeIgniter applications

 

# Updated for PHP 8

```bash

$('document').ready(function () {
 setInterval(function () {getRealData()}, 1000);//request every x seconds

 });
